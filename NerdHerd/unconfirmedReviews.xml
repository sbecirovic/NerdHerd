When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Between some stages, one of three intermission animations plays.[22] Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, he loses a life. Whenever Pac-Man occupies the same tile as an enemy, he is considered to have collided with that ghost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by defaultâ€”DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points or disable the bonus life altogether.</Text><Pictures><Picture1>uploads/hannibal-ultra-hd-background_1_2560x1440-2.jpg</Picture1><Picture2>uploads/evan-rachel-wood-2560x1440-westworld-hd-4k-2519-3.jpg</Picture2><Picture3>uploads/mrrobot_s2_cast_carly-chaikin-1.jpg</Picture3></Pictures></review></unconfirmedReviews>
