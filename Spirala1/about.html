        <h1>About</h1>
        <br>
        <p>After a long day at work, one must find a way to relax. Be it with books, movies, TV shows, music and video games, we all relax in our own way.
          It is quite hard to find a good show, book or a movie. This website will provide you with spoiler-free reviews of each of the listed items.
          Based on the reviews, you can form your own opinion whether to watch something.
        </p>

          NerdHerd is a website created for the lack of one place for all the reviews. Opening a different web pages for different things can be quite tiresome.
          That is why we at NerdHerd want to provide you with hand-picked reviews about entertainment media.
          Feel free to add your own reviews, by which you will expand our little community.
